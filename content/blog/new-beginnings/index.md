A new day. A new beginning. Years passed. Nothing happened chasing perfection. Time to choose and chase something else. It doesn't have to be beautiful as long as it helps you move ahead.  

Understand you have limited time on this planet. Every minute you spend should only help you get better than you were before. 

Build something that works for you. No need of approvals or appraisals. No permissions required. Just go on building. It will surely make you happy. 

Define success. It's different for everyone. If your life is how you want it to be you are successful. And success is a journey, not some destination.
